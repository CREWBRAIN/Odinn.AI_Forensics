EXPLANATORY NOTE

On December 7, 2023, President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. issued Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 13, Series of 2023, entitled: "Authorizing the Grant of Gratuity Pay to Contract of Service and Job Order Workers in the Government for Fiscal Year 2023".

A.O. No. 13 stated that while Contract of Service (COS) and Job Order (JO) workers in the government are paid salaries/wages equivalent to those received by personnel occupying comparable positions in government and a premium of up to 20% of such salary/wage, they do not enjoy benefits accorded to government employees as they have no employer-employee relationship with the government.

It further provided that granting a year-end Gratuity Pay to COS and JO workers is a well-deserved recognition of their hard work in implementing programs, projects and activities, and pivotal role in the delivery of government services amidst the present socio-economic challenges.

Section 5 of A.O. No. 13 mandated that local government units (LGUs) are enjoined to adopt in their respective offices the grant of Gratuity Pay to workers whose services are engaged through COS and JO, utilizing appropriate and available funding sources from their respective local government funds. The corresponding supplemental budget for the purpose shall be enacted by the local sanggunian concerned within FY 2023.

Section 16 of Republic Act No. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991 provides that the LGUs shall exercise the powers that are essential to the promotion of the general welfare. It shall ensure and support, among other things, the enhancement of economic prosperity, full employment, and social justice, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants.

The Local Legislative Body approved Resolution No. 8, adopted by the Executive Committee on the City Development Council, entitled: "A Resolution Approving the Amendment of the Annual Investment Program and the Issuance of a Supplemental Investment Program for FY 2023 for the Grant of Gratuity Pay to Contract of Service and Job Order Workers in the City Government of Manila for FY 2023 Pursuant to Administrative Order No. 13 Series 2023".
